1. In FileZilla, select all files in `/the-energy-museum/frontend/build/`
2. Upload to `/public_html/` (overwrite existing)

### **Option 2: Upload Only Changed Files (Faster)**
1. Upload `index.html` → `/public_html/index.html`
2. Upload `static/js/main.ee6efcdd.js` → `/public_html/static/js/`
3. Upload `static/js/main.ee6efcdd.js.map` → `/public_html/static/js/`

## ✅ Verification:

After upload, check:
1. Visit https://theenergymuseum.com
2. Scroll to footer
3. Verify all three columns have the updated text and links
4. Test a few footer links to ensure they navigate correctly

**The footer navigation is now aligned with your site structure and provides better user experience!** 🎉
